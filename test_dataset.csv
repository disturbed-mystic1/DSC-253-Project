### Context:
Our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter. We test goodwill for impairment by performing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors in assessing the fair value of the related reporting unit. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. Otherwise, no further testing is required. For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is indicated, requiring recognition of a goodwill impairment charge for the differential (up to the carrying value of goodwill).

The Hershey Company conducts annual impairment tests for goodwill either through a qualitative assessment evaluating economic, industry, and company-specific factors, or through a quantitative approach that compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If fair value is less than the carrying amount, a goodwill impairment is recognized.<|eot_id|>"
