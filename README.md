# DSC-253-Project: Enhancing Financial Document Analysis with RAG: A Study on SEC-10K Filings Using LLaMA-3, LoRA, and Retrieval Mechanisms

This project explores the application of RAG on financial documents, particularly SEC-10k fillings. By fine-tuning the LLaMA-3 language model and using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), our system is able to process financial documents efficiently and accurately. We also incorporate a powerful retrieval setup that uses dense vector embeddings and a FAISS-based vector database to ensure the results are relevant and high-performing. In this paper, we compare three SOTA open-source models and two retrieval mechanisms to highlight how our system effectively generates detailed financial insights, tackling the challenges that come with working on large, unstructured financial datasets.
